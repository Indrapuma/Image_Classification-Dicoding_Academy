# Image_Classification-Dicoding_Academy
In this project, I created an image classification model with tensorflow. The architecture used consists of:
- 5 Convolutional layer
- 5 Pooling Layer
- 1 Flatten Layer
- 3 Dense Layer

While the optimizer used is Adamax. The dataset used consists of 3 types of classes, namely: paper, rock, and scissors. Accuracy resulting from the training process exceeds 96% when epochs are less than 20.
